#plpa_6820_assignments
This repository is for PLPA 6820 assignments.
This practice repository will be used as I learn the coding language R and develop my skills using RStudio. The projects contained within are part of my coursework for Auburn University. Specifically, I am taking "Principles and techniques of reproducible science" taught by Dr. Zachary Noel [@noelzach].
